> Our Coaches focus on embedding Agile at the individual team level, using traditional Agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban. 
<!--more-->

<br />     

We may work with one team, or multiple teams and they interact with groups outside of the individual teams, but our focus is on enabling and developing agility at the “make” or “build” level. 

<br />     

We do the very important work of making sure that teams are able to build products the right way, and deliver work sustainably.
