# Design Thinking

Design Thinking is an **iterative process** in which we seek to:
- Understand the user
- Challenge assumptions
- Redefine problems

The aim is to identify alternative strategies and solutions that might not be immediately apparent with our initial level of understanding.  
It provides a **solution-based approach** to solving problems and is both:
- A way of thinking and working
- A collection of hands-on methods

## Design Thinking in Integration Design

Integration requirements are defined by the **business processes** they support.  
In this context, design thinking involves:
- Understanding the business processes
- Identifying problems and inefficiencies in those processes
- Ideating integration capabilities that improve those processes

## Categories of Integration Problems

1. **Data Integration**
   - Typically **batch-oriented**
   - Deals with **data at rest** (the process that created the data has already completed)

2. **Application Integration**
   - Integrates **live operational data** in real-time between two or more applications
   - Can be:
     - **Request-based** — e.g., *"do this now"*
     - **Message-based** — e.g., *"do this when you get a chance"*
     - **Event-based** — e.g., *"this happened"*
   - The mode of integration is driven by:
     - Requirements of the business processes
     - Limitations and constraints of available technologies

# Lean Startup

The **Lean Startup methodology** is a **scientific approach** to problem-solving that uses **feedback data** to guide and accelerate iterative development.  
Key aspects include:
- Assessing options against defined criteria
- Experimenting with technologies and implementation patterns
- Gaining evidence-based knowledge on:
  - Performance
  - Constraints
- Using findings to influence the final design

# Agile

Agile is a **way of working** characterized by:
- Frequent and incremental delivery of product
- Ongoing reassessment and adaptation of plans

---

# API Lifecycle

The API Lifecycle follows the **CI/CD pipeline for API Management (APIM)** approach:  
[Build a CI/CD Pipeline for API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/blog/build-a-ci-cd-pipeline-for-api-management/)
