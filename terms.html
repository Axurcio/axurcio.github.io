        <p>THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE FOR SERVICES (“Terms of Sale”) APPLY TO YOUR PURCHASE OF SERVICES
          PERFORMED BY AXURCIO OR ITS SUBCONTRACTORS AND/OR AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, "SERVICES").&nbsp; By engaging
          Axurcio to perform Services under a Statement of Work (as defined below), you agree to be bound by and accept
          these Terms of Sale, unless you are purchasing such Services pursuant to a separate written agreement signed
          by both your company and Axurcio, in which case, the terms of that separate agreement shall govern.
          &nbsp;Axurcio may, from time to time and at its sole option, revise these Terms of Sale without notice by
          posting them on its website at <a href="https://axurcio.com">axurcio.com</a> &nbsp;(the “Website”). The Terms
          of Sale posted on the Website at the time Axurcio accepts your order governs that purchase.&nbsp; </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong>&nbsp;The description of the scope of work and terms associated with
            the Services ("Statement of Work" or “SOW”) along with these Terms of Sale - Services and any attachments,
            schedules, addenda and exhibits are together one agreement and forms the entire agreement between the
            parties relating to the Services to be performed by Axurcio (the “Agreement”). The Agreement supersedes any
            prior representations or agreements, oral or written, and all other communications between the parties
            relating to the relevant subject matter. Any conflicting, additional or different terms contained in any
            other agreement, invoice or SOW, as the case may be, are expressly rejected, unless the modified Terms of
            Sale is specifically referenced and mutually agreed upon in writing under the SOW.&nbsp; Such modification
            shall be applicable exclusively to that SOW.
            <ul type="disc">
              <li><strong>Competition and Consumer Act (CCA).&nbsp;</strong>Notwithstanding the foregoing, these Terms
                of Sale must be read and construed subject to any statutory provisions, which cannot lawfully be
                excluded, restricted or modified. If any such statutory provisions apply then, to the extent to which
                Axurcio is entitled to do so and at Axurcio's option, Axurcio limits its liability pursuant to such
                provisions to the re-performance or refund of the cost of Services.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Term; Termination</strong>.&nbsp; The Agreement commences upon execution of the relevant SOW
            (“Effective Date”), which incorporates these Terms of Sale, and will continue until completion of the
            Services, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Section.&nbsp; Either party may terminate the
            Agreement, in whole or in part, immediately if the other party materially breaches the Agreement and fails
            to remedy that breach within 30 days after receipt of written notice of such breach, except that a party
            will only have 10 days to remedy any default of its payment obligations. </li>
          <li><strong>Invoicing/Payment</strong>.&nbsp; Services will be invoiced in accordance with the SOW. Services
            will be deemed accepted (completed) 5 days from the date of the invoice, unless otherwise specified in
            writing under the SOW. You must pay all undisputed invoices in full within 30 days of the invoice date,
            unless otherwise specified under the SOW. You agree to pay the total purchase price for the Services, plus
            taxes (including any GST that is payable), and all payments must reference the invoice number. You may
            provide Axurcio with a tax exemption certificate at the time of purchase, which will be subject to review
            and acceptance by Axurcio. Unless otherwise specified, all invoices shall be paid in the currency of the
            invoice.&nbsp; Where invoices are paid in a currency other than that specified on the invoice, you agree to
            remit payment to Axurcio for any losses incurred upon conversion of any payments received that result in a
            short-payment of such invoices.</li>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>Credit/Late Payment.&nbsp; Your order is subject to acceptance and credit approval by Axurcio. You must
              provide appropriate credit references upon request and authorize Axurcio to obtain credit history from
              such references. You agree to pay interest on all past-due amounts at the rate of one and one-half
              percent (1.5%) per month (18% per annum), or such lesser amount determined by Axurcio calculated monthly
              on the past due amount. You will be responsible for Axurcio's costs of collection for any payment
              default, including, but not limited to, court costs, filing fees and attorneys' fees.&nbsp; In addition,
              if payments are not received as described above, Axurcio reserves the right to suspend performance of
              Services until payment is received.</li>
          </ul>

                caused by your failure to provide accurate instructions, information, access to facilities or a
                suitable product or application environment.</li>
              <li>Your sole remedy and Axurcio’s sole obligation for breach of this Limited Services Warranty, except
                as set forth in any SOW that expressly amends this warranty, will be the re-performance of any
                deficient Services at Axurcio's expense. If Axurcio is unable to remedy any deficient Services within
                30 days of notice or such additional time as may be mutually agreed upon, Axurcio will, at its option,
                provide a credit or refund of any fees paid for the specific non-conforming Services.&nbsp; No
                re-performance will extend any warranty period. Any credits issued to you by Axurcio for any reason
                must be applied by you within 2 years from the date the credit is issued. If not used within such
                period, credits will automatically expire.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            THE CCA CLAUSE, THE LIMITED WARRANTIES UNDER SECTION 4 ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
            IMPLIED, AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES. AXURCIO DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE
            IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ARISING

            CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD.</li>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Axurcio retains all right, title and
            interest in any pre-existing intellectual property that is owned by Axurcio ("Axurcio IP"), and which may
            be used in carrying out Services, including any modifications or improvements made to Axurcio IP during or
            as a result of the Services to be performed under the Agreement. Except for Axurcio IP and upon payment in
            full of all amounts due Axurcio, all documents, drawings, specifications, information, patents, patent
            applications, inventions, developments or processes or any copyrightable material originated and developed
            by Axurcio specifically for you as part of the Services to be performed under the Agreement ("Work
            Product") shall be owned by you. Axurcio hereby grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
            perpetual, without the right of sublicense, license to use Axurcio IP in the course of your internal,
            business operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Confidential Information</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Both parties will maintain in confidence
            and safeguard all Confidential Information, as defined in this paragraph, of the other party, its
            affiliates, and its customers. "Confidential Information" means any information that is marked or otherwise
            identified as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure and includes, but is not limited to,
            trade secrets, know-how, inventions, techniques, data, customer lists, Personal Data (as defined herein),
            financial information, sales and marketing plans of the other party, its affiliates, or its customers.
            “Personal Data” means any nonpublic information relating to an identified or identifiable individual that
            may be subject to further obligations of confidentiality under applicable privacy laws.&nbsp; Both parties
            recognize and acknowledge the confidential and proprietary nature of any Confidential Information and
            acknowledge the irreparable harm that could result if such Confidential Information is disclosed to a third
            party or used for unauthorized purposes. Each party agrees to use any Confidential Information only for the
            purpose of conducting business with each other and their clients in the manner contemplated by the
            Agreement. Both parties will restrict disclosures of any Confidential Information to only those personnel
            who have a need to know and will bind such personnel to obligations of confidentiality to the same extent
            that each party is bound by the Agreement. Upon request of the owner of Confidential Information, the other
            party will promptly return all materials incorporating any Confidential Information and any copies. The
            obligations under this paragraph do not apply to information that: (i) is or becomes generally known or in
            the public domain through no act or omission of the other party; (ii) was lawfully in Axurcio's or your
            possession without restriction as to use or disclosure before its receipt from the other party; (iii) is
            received from, or was made available to, a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; (iv) was
            independently developed; (v) is otherwise permitted to be disclosed under the Agreement; (vi) is disclosed
            with the prior written consent of the disclosing party; or (vii) is required to be disclosed in any civil
            or criminal legal proceeding, regulatory proceeding or any similar process, however, the party required to
            make the disclosure under the law shall give prompt notice of this to the other party prior to such
            disclosure so that the other party may seek an appropriate protective order or give its written consent to
            such disclosure.</li>
          <li><strong>Indemnification.&nbsp;</strong>When Services are performed by Axurcio on your premises or at
            another location designated by you, each party and its respective officers, directors, employees, agents
            and affiliates (the “Indemnifying Party”) will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party, its
            officers, directors, employees, agents and affiliates (the Indemnified Party”) from and against any
            damages, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) incurred relating to bodily injury or
            death of any person or damage to tangible personal property occurring at such location in connection with
            the performance of the Services to the extent caused by the negligence or willful acts or omissions of the
            Indemnifying Party.&nbsp; In the event that any such claim is made or suit is commenced, the Indemnified
            Party shall: (i) give prompt written notice of such demand, claim or suit to the Indemnifying Party; and
            (ii) provide reasonable assistance and cooperation in the defense and settlement of any claim or legal
            proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party fails to assume its obligation to
            defend, the Indemnified Party may do so to protect its interests and seek reimbursement from the
            Indemnifying Party.</li>
          <li><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong>&nbsp;No action, whether for indemnification or otherwise,
            regardless of form, arising out of the transaction under the Agreement, may be brought by either party more
            than 1 year after the damage, loss or expense occurred.&nbsp; In addition, to the maximum extent permitted
            by law:
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
                CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF INCOME, PROFITS, DATA, OPERATIONAL
                EFFICIENCY, USE OR INFORMATION,) ARISING UNDER THE AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION OR THEORY
                OF RELIEF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</li>
              <li>THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DIRECT DAMAGES RECOVERABLE FROM A PARTY UNDER THE AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO THE
                TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR TO BE PAID BY YOU FOR SERVICES PERFORMED UNDER THE RELEVANT SOW.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Governing Law and Venue</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;The Agreement will be governed by the
            substantive laws of New South Wales, Australia without giving effect to any conflict of law rules. You are
            responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. Both parties
            specifically agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, the courts of New South Wales,
            Australia in any dispute arising out of or relating to the Agreement.</li>
          <li><strong>General</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Notices to be provided under the Agreement must be in
            writing and sent to the addresses as each party designates under the SOW and are deemed received upon the
            earlier of actual receipt or 3 days after mailing, if mailed postage prepaid by regular mail or airmail or
            1 day after such notice is sent by courier or facsimile transmission. Axurcio will not be liable for, nor
            shall any liability to Axurcio result from, any delays in the performance of the Agreement due to
            circumstances beyond its control, including but not limited to acts of nature, acts of government, national
            emergencies, acts of terrorism, transportation delays, labor disturbances, work stoppages, or material
            shortages. Any additions, deletions or modifications to the Agreement subsequent to the Effective Date are
            not binding unless agreed upon in writing by authorized representatives of both parties. If any part of the
            Agreement is, for any reason, found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
            unenforceable, all other parts will still remain in effect. &nbsp;A delay or failure by either party to
            exercise or partially exercise any right or remedy does not operate as a waiver by that party to thereafter
            enforce such rights. Axurcio may assign or subcontract any or all of its rights or obligations under the
            Agreement without consent. You may not assign the Agreement or any SOW, or any of the rights or obligations
            therein, without Axurcio’s prior written consent. The provisions of the Agreement, which by sense and
            content are intended to survive, including but not limited to the sections related to payment, warranties,
            remedies, confidentiality, indemnification and limits of liability, will survive the expiration or
            termination of the Agreement. The relationship between Axurcio and you is that of independent contractors
            and not that of employer/employee, partnership or joint venture. No personnel employed or engaged by
            Axurcio to perform Services for you will be considered your employees, agents, partners, joint venture
            partners, or franchisors. Axurcio has sole responsibility for the direction of its employees and has the
            right to fire, hire, suspend, layoff, transfer or reassign employees at will without your consent.&nbsp;
            Electronic signatures (or copies of signatures sent via electronic means) are the equivalent of written and
            signed documents.</li>
