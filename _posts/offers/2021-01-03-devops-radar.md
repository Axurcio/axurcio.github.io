> Use the DevOps Radar to guide your way

<!--more-->

> One day facilitated workshop to focus on metrics that will accelerate your software delivery process, how to obtain them and how to improve them

When it comes to measuring an organisationâ€™s ability to develop and operate software systems nothing beats the key metrics identified in the 2019 Accelerate State of DevOps [Report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf) by DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA).  

The report clearly demonstrates the empirical links between high performing software teams and high performing organisations and provides evidence-based guidance on the capabilities and practices that accelerate digital transformation.   

This research, together with our extensive delivery experience, forms the basis of our DevOps practice. 


### The Solution

* Five day engagement schedule to suit your team

* Interviews with technology leaders to evaluate the current state, understand the measurement potential, and determine metrics to measure

* Data analysis to obtain metrics
  
* Radar presentation of insights and detailed action plan for continual improvement


### Benefits and Outcomes

* Identified issues

* Actions for improvement
